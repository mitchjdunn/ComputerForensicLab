\section{Laboratory Design}
This is where we will describe the physical design of the Laboratory will be described, including the number of employees.

\def\numberOfStaff{25}
\def\sqftPer{900}
\subsection{Staffing and Laboratory Size}
According to the NISTIR "Forensic Science Laboratories: Handbook for Facility Planning, Design, Construction, and Relocation", a lab needs to be 700 to 1000 square feet per staff member.The square footage per staff member approaches the low number of that threshold as the number of employees increases because shared spaces, such as reception areas and server rooms don't need to grow at the same rate as the number of employees.  With an estimated \numberOfStaff \space staff members, this lab will require a space of CHANGE ME square feet to achieve the working goal of 800 service requests per year.
