\section{Laboratory Design}

\paragraph{} According to the NISTIR "Forensic Science Laboratories: Handbook for Facility Planning, Design, Construction, and Relocation", a lab needs to be 700 to 1000 square feet per staff member.The square footage per staff member approaches the low number of that threshold as the number of employees increases because shared spaces, such as reception areas and server rooms don't need to grow at the same rate as the number of employees.  With an estimated 8 staff members, this lab will require an approximate space of 6400 square feet to achieve the working goal of 800 service requests per year.

\subsubsection{Staff Breakdown}
\paragraph {Management - 1} 
\paragraph{} The Laboratory Manager is responsible for the well being of the lab.  The manager determines how the lab will operate, which service requests will be fulfilled, will attempt to gain accreditations from ASCLD/LAB, and other administrative work.  The manager will create policies for all of the staff to follow to provide an efficient and ethical workplace.
 
\paragraph{Lawyer - 1} 
\paragraph{} The Lawyer will act as a consult for the Computer Forensics staff to ensure all evidence is extracted legally and to verify the evidence is usable.

\paragraph{IT Specialist - 2}
\paragraph{} The IT Specialists will focus on the internal network and security of the lab.  The IT Specialists will be in charge of securing the hardware including locking evidence in the evidence locker and managing access to the network hardware. The IT Specialist will also act as a System Administrator.  Managing users, limiting communication between VLANs,
